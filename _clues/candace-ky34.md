# Candace Johnson, The Insider

An employee of the gallery who accidentally gave up valuable information about the painting and the security system.

## Background Information

Candace Johnson is an employee of the gallery who has worked there for several years. She is familiar with all of the artwork in the gallery, including the famous painting. Candace is a detail-oriented person who is always looking for ways to improve the gallery's operations.

## Objectives

- Keep her job at the gallery.
- Avoid being implicated if the painting is stolen.

## Relationships

- Roberta Rossi: The curator of the gallery, Candace’s employer.
- Jordan Sidwell: The artist of the famous painting, Roberta’s husband.
- Octavia Knight: The owner of the famous painting on display at the gallery.
- Sofia Hernandez: A wealthy art collector, who Candace met at the showing.

## Hidden Information

- Candace fears Sofia plans to steal the painting. Sofia approached Candace before the showing and started talking about the famous painting. Candace was lured in by the chance to discuss art with a renowned collector and accidentally revealed information about the gallery's security system, at which point Sofia smiled and walked away.
- Candace revealed to Roberta that she accidentally gave critical information to Sofia and now Roberta wants to fire her. This would be devastating for Candace because she needs this job and Roberta’s recommendation to get accepted into art school.
- Candace knows Octavia has an insurance policy for the valuable painting. Candace learned about the insurance policy while working with the gallery's financial records and is worried about the consequences of the theft for the gallery's reputation and finances.
- Candace knows how to tell the authentic painting from fakes. In the authentic piece, the striped cat in the bottom left frame has its left pupil (from the viewer’s perspective) looking down and to the right.
