# Alesia Ivanova, The Forger

An expert in art forgery, who has created a convincing replica of the valuable painting.

## Background Information

Alesia Ivanova is a master forger who has been in the business for over twenty years. After studying at a prestigious art school in Moscow, Alesia began working as a professional artist, but quickly realized that her true passion was in creating forgeries. Alesia honed her skills over the years, becoming one of the top forgers in the art world. But she needs money to continue her craft and care for her ailing mother.

## Objectives

- Make a large profit from the stolen painting to take care of herself and her mother.
- Keep her involvement in the heist and forgery a secret.

## Relationships

- Roberta Rossi: The curator of the gallery.
- Jordan Sidwell: The artist of the famous painting, Roberta’s husband.
- Octavia Knight: The owner of the famous painting on display at the gallery.
- Devika Mitra: A talented hacker, who found Alesia on the dark web.
- Beatrice Laroche: An art critic, who attends the gallery showing.

## Hidden Information

- Alesia targets Octavia to steal the painting she owns. She desires recognition for her work, although she knows that as a forger, she can never receive it openly.
- Alesia uses Devika to break into the vault. Devika reached out to Alesia for her forgery skills. Devika has a way to hide the painting until after the showing. Then, Alesia will sell the painting to her buyer and split the profits with Devika.
- Alesia knows Beatrice hates Octavia because they are rivals in the art world. Alesia reads Beatrice’s critique column often because she finds her content laughable. For example, Beatrice unironically argues that keeping artists poor results in better art, while she herself is lavishly wealthy. Beatrice likes people who agree with her.
- Alesia actually created two forgeries of the painting. If she needs to, she can give the second forgery to someone else and keep the real painting for herself.
