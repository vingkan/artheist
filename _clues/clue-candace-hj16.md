# Pamphlet For Candace

You skim a pamphlet from the gallery about the famous painting that will be shown.

## “Fiduciary Felines”

_By Jordan Sidwell_

- The painting "Fiduciary Felines" explores complex themes through color and form, questioning the value of material wealth and the nature of human desire.
The feline figures in the painting represent the pursuit of joy and amusement, inviting - viewers to reflect on the meaning and purpose of their own lives, and consider whether the pursuit of material success is truly the path to fulfillment.
- The artist's own life experience has taught him the importance of simplicity and finding joy in everyday experiences, which he seeks to convey through his work.

## Update For Candace

Other guests will want to discuss the painting. However, you are preoccupied because...

> Roberta Rossi, the gallery curator and your boss, told you that she would go to the vault to retrieve the famous painting, because you are too incompetent to be trusted with it. She demanded that you bring her the tea she asked for. You mixed a toxic compound into the drink and brought it to Roberta. She drank the tea quickly and ran off to the vault.
