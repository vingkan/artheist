# Pamphlet For Jordan

You skim a pamphlet from the gallery about the famous painting that will be shown.

## “Fiduciary Felines”

_By Jordan Sidwell_

- The painting "Fiduciary Felines" explores complex themes through color and form, questioning the value of material wealth and the nature of human desire.
The feline figures in the painting represent the pursuit of joy and amusement, inviting - viewers to reflect on the meaning and purpose of their own lives, and consider whether the pursuit of material success is truly the path to fulfillment.
- The artist's own life experience has taught him the importance of simplicity and finding joy in everyday experiences, which he seeks to convey through his work.

## Update For Jordan

Other guests will want to discuss the painting. However, you are preoccupied because...

> As you were walking past the vault, you heard a cry for help that you recognized as Roberta Rossi, your wife and the curator of the gallery. She beckoned for you to let her out, saying someone had stolen her painting. You were enraged that she would think of your painting that Octavia owns as her own. You went to the vault security panel, used Roberta’s administrative access code, and depressurized the oxygen from the room.
