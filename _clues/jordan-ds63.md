# Jordan Sidwell, The Artist

The talented artist of the painting on display, who is married to the gallery curator.

## Background Information

Jordan Sidwell was a talented artist who struggled financially until he married Roberta Rossi, a wealthy art curator and gallery owner. After their marriage, Jordan's career flourished as he sold paintings to Roberta's wealthy friends and clients. However, their marriage became strained over time as he felt suffocated by her control over his career.

## Objectives

- Keep his inheritance from Roberta's will.
- Maintain his reputation as a successful artist.
- Avoid being exposed for his personal issues.

## Relationships

- Roberta Rossi: The curator of the gallery, Jordan’s wife.
- Octavia Knight: An art collector who owns Jordan’s famous painting.
- Naomi Wu: An art dealer who admires Jordan’s works.

## Hidden Information

- Jordan hates Roberta and wants a divorce. However, she willed him her fortune, so dissolving the marriage will be complicated.
Jordan knows Naomi is angry that Octavia owns his famous painting. Naomi originally - placed the highest bid she could for the painting, but Octavia won it.
- Jordan sold Octavia his painting even though her bid was actually lower than Naomi’s bid because Octavia threatened to reveal that Jordan hates Roberta.
- Jordan knows Naomi thinks Octavia legitimately outbid her for his painting.
- Jordan knows Roberta’s administrative access code to the gallery vault.
- As the original artist, Jordan knows how to tell his authentic painting from fakes. In the authentic piece, the striped cat in the bottom left frame has its left pupil (from the viewer’s perspective) looking down and to the left.
