## “Fiduciary Felines”

_By Jordan Sidwell_

- The painting "Fiduciary Felines" explores complex themes through color and form, questioning the value of material wealth and the nature of human desire.
The feline figures in the painting represent the pursuit of joy and amusement, inviting - viewers to reflect on the meaning and purpose of their own lives, and consider whether the pursuit of material success is truly the path to fulfillment.
- The artist's own life experience has taught him the importance of simplicity and finding joy in everyday experiences, which he seeks to convey through his work.
