# Update For Candace

The authorities gave you a private update. For some reason, the late Roberta Rossi left instructions that the vault should be left open during the showing of her famous art piece. The staff will place hors dâ€™oeuvres in the vault room and open up access to the attendees.

The authorities have finished their work at the crime scene, but attendees are still not permitted to leave the building. At this time, we have not found the murder weapon.
