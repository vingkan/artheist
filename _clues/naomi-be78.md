# Naomi Wu, The Art Dealer

A rival art dealer who was outbid in the auction for the painting.

## Background Information

Naomi Wu is a renowned art dealer, known for her keen eye for rare and valuable pieces. She has been in the business for over a decade, and has established herself as a fierce competitor. However, Naomi has had a long-standing feud with the owner of the painting on display over a past deal gone wrong, which has caused her to lose respect within the art community.

## Objectives

- Steal the famous painting on display at the gallery and avoid being caught.
- Attend the exhibition and make a good impression on potential clients.
- Get revenge on the owner of the painting for causing her to lose the past deal.

## Relationships

- Roberta Rossi: The curator of the gallery.
- Jordan Sidwell: The artist of the famous painting, whose work Naomi admires.
- Octavia Knight: An art collector who owns Jordan’s famous painting.
- Devika Mitra: A talented hacker, who Naomi hires to steal the painting.
- Beatrice Laroche: An art critic whose opinions annoy Naomi.

## Hidden Information

Naomi originally bid $5MM in the auction for Jordan’s famous painting. The auctioneer told her she had the highest bid, but then just before the auction closed, she learned - that she had been outbid and the painting would go to her rival, Octavia Knight, who would be unveiling it to the public at a special exhibition at Roberta Rossi’s gallery. For this, Naomi vows revenge on Octavia.
Naomi hires Devika to steal the valuable painting for her and offers to buy it from her - for $4MM if she can successfully steal it from Roberta’s gallery.
Naomi hates Beatrice because she uses her art critique column to advocate against - measures that will help poor artists.
Naomi knows how to tell the authentic painting from fakes. In the authentic piece, the - striped cat in the bottom left frame has its left pupil (from the viewer’s perspective) looking down and to the right.
