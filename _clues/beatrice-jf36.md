An art critic who is attending the exhibition and is known for her strong opinions.

## Background Information

Beatrice Laroche is a well-known art critic who prides herself on her honesty and integrity. She has been attending art exhibitions for years and has built up a reputation for her sharp tongue and scathing reviews. However, her personal life is a mess, and she often uses her criticism of art to mask her own insecurities.

## Objectives

- Prove to the other guests that her opinion is more valuable than anyone else's.

## Relationships

- Roberta Rossi: The curator of the gallery, who invited Beatrice.
- Jordan Sidwell: The artist of the famous painting that Beatrice came to critique.
- Octavia Knight: The owner of the painting, who Beatrice also came to write about.

## Hidden Information

- Beatrice has a drinking problem and is deeply under the influence during the event.
- Beatrice hates Octavia and writes scathing critiques of the artwork in her collection because it helps her gain clout in the art world.
- Beatrice believes that if artists become too wealthy, they lose their motivation to create groundbreaking art. Beatrice has published many articles in her art critique column advocating that paid internships, art scholarships, and royalties are a waste of funding that negatively impact the art community. Beatrice loves to meet people who agree with her.
